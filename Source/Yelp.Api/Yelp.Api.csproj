    <PackageReleaseNotes>1.4.0 - Tuesday, Sept 25th, 2018
- Fixed multithreading for GetBusinessAsyncInParallel and GetGraphQlInChunksAsyncInParallel so they actually send calls in parallel.  Consumer can also set how many threads they use, default is 2.
- Fixed GetGraphQlInChunksAsync so it actually makes calls in series as intended.
- Increased default size of businesses sent through GraphQl calls from 5 to 25 due to improvements to the Yelp API.  This can also be changed by the consumer.
- Calls to Yelp API now have mechanics to automatically retry if they fail due to endpoint flooding.  Use the ConnectionRetrySettings class to change these settings.
- This package will now throw AccessLimitExceptions if Yelp returns ACCESS_LIMIT_REACHED (for when you go over your daily amount of calls allowed).
- General clean up and bug fixes.
- Enhancements, clarifications, and fixes to the Example project.
